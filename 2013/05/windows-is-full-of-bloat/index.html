</p>      <p>It's been some time since I've had to do some work on a Windows
computer, in particular lots of software installs and uninstalls to
cleanup a slow computer.</p>
<p>Now before you jump the gun, I'm not talking about Windows the operating
system being full of bloat, although it may be. I'm also not talking
about the bloat that comes installed on OEM installs.</p>
<p>What I am talking about, is how so much third party free windows
software is full of bloat. Just about every installer now wants to
install another piece of software with the piece you downloaded, ether a
toolbar or another "great" piece of software they recommend to you. And
then when you uninstall a piece of software, just about every piece of
software then insist on opening a webpage saying how sorry they are that
you uninstalled the software and would you please do this 5 minute
survey telling them why blah blah blah.</p>
<p>And even my favourite antivirus Avast has started doing it. First, the
installer has jumped from 20Mb a few years ago to over 100Mb now. And
now when you install it, if you aren't watching out it'll try and
install Google Drive, and once it is installed it keeps popping up
asking you to install the great security extension for chrome, blah blah
blah.</p>
<p>What ever happened to nice free software that wasn't packed full of
bloat, and that let you install and uninstall just that software that
you asked for without trying to push other software on you? I'll happily
keep my Linux world, where software does what you ask, and nothing more.</p>
<p>And if you live in the Windows world, seriously, I think it's well past
time to get out, but you can still get out now!</p>
