<p>The first ddrescue command tries to fly through the disk as quickly as
possible, skipping over sections when an error occurs. This allows me to
recover most of the good data as quickly as possible. The second command
(which is only needed if you had errors found with the first command)
will then retry the bad sections of disk, splitting the error sections
into smaller and smaller parts until you eventually have individual
blocks that are damaged. It is here that ddrescue really works hard to
recover your data, and this part can take just as long as the first
part.</ins></p>
<p>So you have successfully used ddrescue to recover everything you can off
a failing hard drive. Now you have a big image file, maybe 500Gb, with
sectors that could be recovered, and those that couldn't. But how do you
find which files belong to the broken sectors? I recently had this
problem with a FAT32 filesystem. After lots and lots of googling, I
still didn't have a decent answer. Windows has a tool called DiskView,
however it doesn't appear to work on disk images. There is also a Hex
viewer around that apparently will tell you which files belong to the
sector you are viewing, but I had no luck with that ether.</p>
<p>Eventually I stumbled across a toolset I should have used from the
start. The Sleuth Kit. I also stumbled across a paper someone had
written doing some forensics with The Sleuth Kit which pointed me to the
right tools, although some had changed names.</p>
<p>However, let me first point you to a fairly simple way that is hidden in
the ddrescue info pages. While at first it sounds like this method
should be the long hard way, it actually works out to be the easiest
way.</p>
<p>It is suggested in the ddrescue info pages that you md5sum all the files
in the image, then using ddrescue in fill mode you write some data (that
isn't all zero's) to the sections that couldn't be recovered, and then
md5sum all the files again and compare. Seeing as I had already copied
all the files off the image, it was actually even simplier than that. I
wrote the random data to the damaged sections (in this case "BADSECTOR"
over and over again) and then did a diff between the files on the image
and the files I had already copied off the image. It did take awhile to
do the diff, but 4hrs to compare 180Gb of files with 180Gb of files,
over a network isn't that bad. I'm sure it would have been a lot quicker
had all the files resided on the local machine onÂ  a nice RAID array.</p>
<p>So a simplified example</p>
<p>copy all files off rescued image (loop mount) to another location</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="s">&quot;BAD SECTOR &quot;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">tmpfile</span>

</pre></div>


<p>You'll then have a list of files that differ between the 2 versions,
which are the ones with damaged sectors. Also, the ddrescue doesn't
damage the logfile so you can then reverse it using /dev/zero to restore
the image to it's original recovery state. This won't work with sparse
files.</p>

<p><ins datetime="2011-08-11T21:42:04+00:00"><strong>This is all you need when
trying to work out which files are damaged. The following is another
method for really peaking into the file system that may be more useful
for deeper analysis</strong></ins></p>
<p>However, if you do want to find out which files are in the damaged
sectors, then continue as it is possible.</p>
<p>First, check that the sector is actually used. This used to be the dstat
command, but it has since been renamed to blkstat. So we take a sector
number from the logfile that couldn't be recovered.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">cat</span> <span class="n">rescue</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">log</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">grep</span> <span class="o">-|</span><span class="n">head</span>

<p>We then convert it to a sector number. I know the sector size is 512
bytes in this case, but you will need to verify it for your drive. If in
doubt, do the conversion, open a hexeditor, jump to that location, use
the previous ddrescue command to fill in the badsectors with some known
next, and confirm that the known text is at the address you are
viewing.<br />
I've picked sector 0x2BEEFF0A00 to analyise. So I convert it to decimal
and dived by 512 (the sector size). I can do this all at once if I know
that 512 in hex is 200.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s">&quot;ibase=16; 2BEEFF0A00/200&quot;</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">bc</span>
<span class="mi">368541573</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Or do it the long way</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s">&quot;ibase=16; 2BEEFF0A00&quot;</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">bc</span>

<span class="mi">368541573</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Ether way, I now know that the sector number is 368541573. Using blkstat
(formerly dstat) I can verify that the sector is used or not.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">blkstat</span> <span class="n">rescued</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="mi">368541573</span>
<span class="nl">Sector:</span> <span class="mi">368541573</span>
<span class="n">Allocated</span>
<span class="nl">Cluster:</span> <span class="mi">5754738</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now a little warning, if you get a sector that looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">blkstat</span> <span class="n">rescued</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="mi">48249</span>
<span class="nl">Sector:</span> <span class="mi">48249</span>
<span class="n">Allocated</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Meta</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then you are probably looking at a sector in a directory listing. The
next tool we are going to use, ifind, may take a very long time to
process that sector for almost no gain. I would leave these sectors
until you have processed the others. I believe this one for me actually
is in one of the FAT's, which just told me that the FAT was probably
damaged. What I can do is work with the damaged FAT initially, then
switch over to the other FAT and see what is different. (Which I won't
cover in this post) <ins datetime="2011-04-18T23:52:56+00:00">On further
investigation, it turns out this sector was in an unused part of the
FAT, so had caused no damage to the FAT. Damage to the fat could prevent
you from even seeing some of the files, so hopefully when you have
damage to the FAT your 2nd FAT will still be good.</ins></p>
<p>Our next step is to use ifind to find the inode associated with the
sector. This can take some time and lots of CPU.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">time</span> <span class="n">ifind</span> <span class="n">rescued</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">d</span> <span class="mi">368541573</span>
<span class="mi">5892375559</span>

<span class="n">real</span>    <span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">m52</span><span class="mf">.314</span><span class="n">s</span>
<span class="n">user</span>    <span class="mi">1</span><span class="n">m15</span><span class="mf">.280</span><span class="n">s</span>
<span class="n">sys</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="n">m2</span><span class="mf">.170</span><span class="n">s</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This finally gives us the inode associated with that file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">istat</span> <span class="n">rescued</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="mi">5892375559</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">head</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">12</span>

<span class="nl">Sectors:</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The listing then goes on to show all sectors that the file uses. If we
grep the listing, we can confirm that the sector 5892375559 is in that
file. Unfortunately, we are stuck with the 8.3 filename and not the
complete filename. Thankfully another tool will come to our rescue. If
you are looking for a good number of files that are affected (i.e. more
than 1 or 2 sectors) you'll want to run this command without the grep,
and save the contents to a file so you can just grep over that file each
time as it takes a long time to recursively list all the files in a big
filesystem.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="err">$</span> <span class="n">fls</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">rFp</span> <span class="n">bunsom</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">grep</span> <span class="mi">5892375559</span>

</pre></div>


<p>So finally we can see that the inode 5892375559, which contains our
damaged sector, belongs to this file from the Microsoft Office Chart
Converter App. (Yes, it does look a little strange this file but that's
because it's a OS X App file).</p>
<p>We can now repeat this for all damaged sectors. However, I'd be first
getting a list of all sectors (remember that the second column in the
ddrescue log is size of the damaged area, use that to work out who many
sectors in a row are damaged). I'd then check the file we have just
found (use the istat tool) to see if any of the other damaged sectors
are also in that file.</p>
